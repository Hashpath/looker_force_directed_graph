# Force-Directed Graph

Use a force-directed graph to show relationships between entities in your data.

Nodes within the graph are mathematically clustered together based-on their relationship with other nodes. The weight of the link (line between nodes) is based on the magnitude of the relationship.

Force-directed graphs are particularly effective for visualizing how various entities (dimensions) are connected to each other.

This diagram requires exactly 4 dimensions and 1 measure. It was built using the D3 visualization library.

Dimension 1: node value 1
Dimension 2: node value 1 group
Dimension 3: node value 2
Dimension 3: node value 2 group
Measure 1: value of relationship
